Solutions of exercises from 'Introduction to Algorithms' CLRS (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein) implemented in Golang.

The solutions have been grouped with their tests. The comments on top of each program mention:
1. The problem number in the CLRS book where the format is 'chapter.section.exercise' 
2. A description of the algorithm 
3. Worst, Average and Best Case Performance
4. Worst Case Space Complexity
